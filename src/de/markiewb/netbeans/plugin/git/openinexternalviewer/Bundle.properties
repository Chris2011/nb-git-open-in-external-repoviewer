    <html>\nThis plugins adds an new action "<i>Open 'origin/branchname' at 'XXX</i>' to the context menu of a GIT-versioned project.\n\
    <p>\nIt parses the GIT URL of the project, generates an URL for the commit history page (at the matching GIT repository hoster) based on predefined patterns and opens the URL in the external browser.\n\
    </p>\n<img src="https://raw.github.com/markiewb/nb-git-open-in-external-repoviewer/master/doc/screenshot1.png"/>\n<p>\nCurrently supported patterns: GitBlit, BitBucket, GitHub, GoogleCode, GitWeb\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b> It only works for tracked branches. \
